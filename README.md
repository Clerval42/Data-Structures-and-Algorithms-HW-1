# Expression Evaluator

This project was made for Eski≈üehir Technical University CS course Data Structures and Algorithms Homework 1: Application of Stacks: Expression Evaluator.

# Description

This project demonstrates how to evaluate arithmetic expressions that contain basic operations (+, -, \*, /) and parentheses. It converts infix expressions to postfix (reverse polish notation) and uses a stack to calculate the given expression.

## Getting Started

To start the project, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Clerval42/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-HW-1
```

Build the project using Maven:

```
mvn clean install
```

Run the tests:

```
mvn test
```

You can run ``TestEvaluate.java`` to see outputs.

Here are some example inputs:

- `20+2*3+(2*8+5)*4`
- `10+3*5+(4*6+7)*2`
- `15+4*2+(3*7+8)*5`
- `5+6*3+(2*9+4)*7`
- `8+2*4+(5*3+6)*2`
- `12+3*7+(4*5+2)*3`
